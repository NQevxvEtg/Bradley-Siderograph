# Bradley-Siderograph

This GitHub repository contains an open-source implementation of the algorithms and techniques presented in Donald A. Bradley's book "Stock Market Prediction, The Planetary Barometer and How to Use It." The project offers a comprehensive toolset to predict stock market trends using geocentric, heliocentric, and planetocentric astrological graphs. Users can generate these graphs based on planetary positions and analyze their impact on financial markets, leveraging the power of Bradley's planetary barometer methodology.
